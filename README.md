üëã Hello and welcome to my profile!

My name is Pablo, I‚Äôm 31 years old, and I currently live in Dublin, Ireland. I have always been deeply connected to the world of technology, and the blockchain universe has truly captured my heart. Today, my journey is focused on Solidity and Web3 security, areas that have become my true passion.

I am a certified Blockchain Engineer with growing experience in developing smart contracts and security protocols for decentralized applications. My goal is to contribute to the evolution of secure blockchain systems, combining my knowledge of Solidity and security practices to create solutions that ensure the integrity and protection of decentralized ecosystems. üöÄ



### Welcome to my GitHub

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract GitHubProfile {
    string public welcomeMessage;

    constructor() {
        console.log("Deploying GitHubProfile");
        welcomeMessage = "Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!";
    }

    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
        console.log("Introducing the welcome message: %s", welcomeMessage);
        return welcomeMessage;
    }
}

```
